# Mac Miller Music Emotion Analysis üéµ

A personal exploration into the emotional landscape of Mac Miller‚Äôs albums. This project dives deep into his lyrics to uncover what he might have been feeling during different phases of his life, highlighting the underlying emotions in his songs across three albums: *Balloonerism*, *Swimming*, and *Circles*.

## üåü Project Overview

Mac Miller has always been one of my favorite artists. His music is honest, raw, and metaphorical. Even if you don‚Äôt fully relate to the lyrics, he has this unique ability to **make you feel** his music.

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how his emotions evolved across different albums. This project analyzes his lyrics to visualize the emotions he expressed, giving insight into his mindset during the years he made these albums:

* **Balloonerism (2014)** ‚Äì Peak of addiction, heavy substance use, rising fame but feeling depressed.
* **Swimming (2016)** ‚Äì Attempting sobriety, processing struggles, learning to "swim" through depression.
* **Circles (2018)** ‚Äì Acceptance of struggles, softer, more resigned emotions.

The analysis uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM** to extract dominant emotions, **pandas** for cleaning and reshaping the data, and **Plotly** for creating interactive charts throughout the **Streamlit dashboard**.
